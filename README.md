- 🧑‍💻 I mostly use [Python](https://www.python.org) for data analysis and bioinformatics.
  - Does not mean I don't like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) too 😉
- 🪴 I mostly use [PHP](https://www.php.net/) for web development.
   - 🔨 I love and spend a lot of time using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
   - 🔨 I love [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and have built a ton of projects with it.
   - 🔨 I love using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for a variety of tasks such as caching, turnstiling, CDN optimizations, domain registrations etc.
- ℹ️ **If my Github activity and social media accounts seem dormant, it's because I have been at school and I have been learning new things. I plan to start blogging about my learning journey and personal projects soon**
